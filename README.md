# AnyListProMax

Fork of [bobby060/anylist-mcp](https://github.com/bobby060/anylist-mcp) that adds what AnyList's own API supports but other MCP servers skip: **item prices, package sizes, UPC barcodes and photos**. Set them with `set_item_pricing` and `set_item_photo` (see [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md)); `list_items` shows prices and package sizes.

Everything below is the upstream documentation.

# Unofficial AnyList MCP Server

An MCP server that integrates with [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) — shopping lists, recipes, and meal planning — exposed via the Model Context Protocol. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Claude Web/Mobile, or any MCP-compatible client like Home Assistant.

Two deployment modes:
- **Local (stdio)** — runs on your machine alongside Claude Desktop or Claude Code. Fastest setup, no server required.
- **HTTP server** — runs in Docker behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. Required for Claude Web, Claude Mobile, or home assistant and useful for sharing access across devices or users.

## Tools Overview

The MCP server provides **5 domain-grouped tools** rather than 18+ individual ones:

- **shopping** — Manage shopping lists and items: add, check off, delete, organize by category and store, and browse favorites
- **recipes** — Browse, create, and import recipes from URLs; includes ingredient and step parsing
- **meal_plan** — Schedule meals on a calendar with optional links to recipes
- **recipe_collections** — Organize recipes into curated named collections
- **health_check** — Verify your connection to AnyList and access to target lists

These tools work together to enable typical workflows: browse or create recipes → plan meals → add ingredients to your shopping list. See [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md) for the complete reference including all actions and parameters.

## Installation: Claude Desktop

The fastest way to get started is to download the latest `anylist-mcp.mcpb` from the [releases page](../../releases).

1. Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Extensions
2. Drag and drop the `.mcpb` file, or click "Advanced settings" → Install extension
3. Enter your configuration when prompted:
   - **AnyList Email** — your AnyList account email
   - **AnyList Password** — your AnyList account password
   - **Default Shopping List** — optional, defaults to "Groceries"

---

## Installation: Claude Code / Claude Desktop (from source)

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
- An [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) account

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bobby060/anylist-mcp.git
cd anylist-mcp
make install
```

Add to your MCP config (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` or equivalent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anylist": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/anylist-mcp/src/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "ANYLIST_USERNAME": "you@example.com",
        "ANYLIST_PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
        "ANYLIST_LIST_NAME": "Groceries"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation: Claude Web / Claude Mobile

Claude Web and Mobile require an HTTP MCP server accessible over HTTPS. This project includes a Docker-based HTTP server designed to run behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. The server is designed for self-hosting, but can theoretically support any number of users. You can (should?) restrict what email addresses are allowed to create accounts in the `allowed-emails.txt` file. 

See **[docs/cloudflare-setup.md](docs/cloudflare-setup.md)** for the full setup guide, including:
- Quick tunnel for development (no Cloudflare account needed)
- Named tunnel for production (stable URL on your own domain)

**Quick start:**

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bobby060/anylist-mcp.git
cd anylist-mcp

# Configure
cp .env.http.example .env          # fill in SERVER_SECRET_KEY and SESSION_SECRET
mkdir -p config
cp allowed-emails.example.txt config/allowed-emails.txt   # add your email

# Start server + Cloudflare quick tunnel
make dev
# Watch logs for the trycloudflare.com URL, then add it as an MCP server in Claude Settings/Connectors
```

## Generating OAuth Client Credentials (for Home Assistant / headless clients)

Some MCP clients — like Home Assistant — require a pre-registered `client_id` and `client_secret` rather than dynamic client registration. You create a confidential client once, then enter the credentials in your integration. Home Assistant will still send you through a one-time browser login (authorization code flow) to link your account.

**Prerequisites:** the HTTP server must already be running and you must have an account on it.

```bash
# The server must be running (make dev or make prod)
make create-client EMAIL=you@example.com NAME="Home Assistant"
```

This prints a `client_id` and `client_secret`. **Save the secret immediately** — it is hashed in the database and cannot be retrieved later.

The server URL (what you enter in HA) is:

```
https://<your-tunnel-domain>
```

See **[docs/home-assistant.md](docs/home-assistant.md)** for step-by-step Home Assistant setup.

## Development

```bash
make test                # unit tests (no credentials needed)
make test-integration    # integration tests (requires .env with real credentials)
make inspect             # launch the MCP inspector
```

Before opening a pull request, read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — new
features and bug fixes must ship with unit tests, plus integration tests for
anything that touches the AnyList API.

### Building the desktop extension

```bash
make pack   # produces anylist-mcp.mcpb
```

## Roadmap

- **Google OAuth** — allow users to sign in to the HTTP MCP server with their Google account instead of a separate password.
- **Web gui-based workflow for created oauth client credentials**
